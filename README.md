# Flight_Delay
## Flight Delays and Cancellations
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
The file I use in creating data visualizations is the flights.csv file.

### Summary/Insight:
My visualization is based on the statement, â€œHighlight Airports and Airlines that were affected by the delay factors in 2015.
I created a story with tree dashboard for the final result.
